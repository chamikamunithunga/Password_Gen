Explanation:
-------------
Digits Generation: digit1 and digit2 are generated using chr(random.randint(48, 57)), which produces random digits.

Lowercase Letter: I corrected the generation of lowercaseLetter7 to ensure it's a lowercase letter by using ASCII codes 97-122.

Password Construction: The final password string is constructed by concatenating all the generated letters and digits.

Shuffling: The shuffle function is used to randomize the order of characters in the final password.


hope to connect this back end project to html5 front end and enhance this project for improve my python language using for future works.....
